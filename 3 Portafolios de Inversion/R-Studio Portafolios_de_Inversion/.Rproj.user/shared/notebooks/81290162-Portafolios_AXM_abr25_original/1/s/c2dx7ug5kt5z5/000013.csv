"0","# To coerce means to force an object of one class into an object of another class. It's an explicit conversion. When you coerce a time-series object to a tibble, you are essentially restructuring the data from its specialized time-series format into a standard, tidy table format. This conversion typically involves:"
"0",""
"0","#Creating a column for the time or date index."
"0","#Creating one or more columns for the data values."
"0",""
"0","#For example, a time-series object might be a vector with a hidden time attribute. Coercing it to a tibble would create a two-column tibble: one column for the date/time and another for the data values. This makes it much more straightforward to perform operations like filtering by date, summarizing data, or creating visualizations using ggplot2."
